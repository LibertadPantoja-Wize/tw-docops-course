After that, Libertad pursued a PhD in Biomedical Sciences. She previously worked in Data Science, focusing on banking data analytics. Her work also involved to transform the analytics portal in sata scientists friendly site. Libertad loves bringing a better understanding of the tools and processes that take place in the technological daily life. She aims to become a better writer (both in English and Spanish) of speculative fiction stories. In her free time Libertad enjoys doing yoga, spending time with her family, reading, drawing, and playing board games and videogames. Selected Past Work Gradute studies. Libertad published two academic papers during this project. The main technologies she used were shell script, R and Python (mostly for plots and simulations). Data Scientist. She worked for the last three years as a Data Scientist for the banking industry in the context of Big Data in Datio. The first project in which she worked there was an investment recommender. It was challenging and really fun. The main technology used for that project was Python along with Spark (pySpark).","title":"Home"},{"location":"#libertad-pantoja","text":"","title":"Libertad Pantoja"},{"location":"#technical-writer-wizeline","text":"Libertad originally majored in Genomic Sciences where she was exposed to Big Data Analytics for the first time.
