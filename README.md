DocOps course for Technical Writers repository

Hello, I am Libertad Pantoja, and this is my Readme example for the DocOps course for Technical Writers. I am not sure about what to write here. In the meanwhile, you can visit my writing sites:

* [Flying Fugu in substack](https://flyingfugu.substack.com/)
* [Flying Fugu in WordPress](https://libertadph.wordpress.com/)

Or, if creative writing is not your thing, you can visit my personal Github or read one of my papers (they are far from spectacular but I did them):
1. [Personal Github](https://github.com/LiberPH)
2. [Frontier's Loop profile](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/200142/overview)
