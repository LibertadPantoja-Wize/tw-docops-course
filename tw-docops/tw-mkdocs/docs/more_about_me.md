# More about me

I love writing speculative fiction short stories. You can read about my creative process here:

* English: [Flying Fugu in substack](https://flyingfugu.substack.com/)
* Spanish (hopefully up to date): [Flying Fugu in WordPress](https://libertadph.wordpress.com/)

These are some of my favorite short stories:

| Spanish           | English  |
|:-------------:| :-----:|
| [A la deriva](https://www.ingenieria.unam.mx/dcsyhfi/material_didactico/Literatura_Hispanoamericana_Contemporanea/Autores_Q/QUIROGA/A.pdf) | [Catskin](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/catskin/) |
| [Futura nereida](https://www.lashistorias.com.mx/index.php/archivo/futura-nereida/)      |  [All you, zombies](https://gist.github.com/defunkt/759182/ad44c6135d168ae54503a281bb7e1a24c6c2ea0c)  |


Or, if creative writing is not your thing, you can visit my personal Github or read one of my papers (they are far from spectacular but I did them):
